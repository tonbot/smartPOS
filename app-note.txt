Sure, here's a list of pages you might consider including in your inventory web app:

1. **Homepage**: This could display an overview of the app's features and possibly some statistics about the inventory.

2. **Login/Register Page**: Allow users to create an account or log in if they already have one.

3. **Dashboard**: Upon logging in, users should see a dashboard displaying summary information about their inventory, such as total items, low stock alerts, recent activity, etc.

4. **Inventory List**: This page displays a list of all items in the inventory. Each item could include details such as name, description, quantity, category, etc. Users might be able to search, filter, and sort this list.

5. **Item Detail Page**: Clicking on an item from the inventory list should take the user to a page with more detailed information about that specific item.

6. **Add/Edit Item Page**: Users should be able to add new items to the inventory or edit existing ones. This page would include forms for entering or modifying item details.

7. **Categories Page**: If your inventory is organized into categories, you might have a page that lists all the available categories and allows users to filter the inventory by category.

8. **Reports/Analytics Page**: This page could provide various reports and analytics about the inventory, such as sales trends, inventory turnover, etc.

9. **Settings Page**: Allow users to customize their account settings, such as profile information, notification preferences, etc.

10. **User Management Page**: If your app supports multiple users with different roles (e.g., admin, regular user), you might need a page for managing user accounts and permissions.

11. **About/Contact Page**: Provide information about the app, its developers, and how users can get in touch for support or feedback.

12. **Error Pages**: It's essential to have custom error pages for 404 (page not found), 500 (internal server error), etc., to handle unexpected situations gracefully.

Remember, this is just a basic list, and you can expand or customize it based on your specific requirements and the complexity of your inventory management system.
